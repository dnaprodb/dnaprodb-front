# DNAproDB - Front End
DNAproDB is a web-based structure processing pipeline, database and visualization tool for the structural analysis of DNA-protein complexes. This repository contains the code and resources we use to build the DNAproDB web server and front-end. Our front-end is built using a combination of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript and Python CGI scripts. The DNAproDB database is run on MongoDB version 3.4 and is queried via python scripts and the PyMongo MongoDB API. 

## Visualizations
Our visualizations are built with d3.js version 5.
